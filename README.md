# RandomFun
我随便做的欢乐小模组

To learn java and fabric, and also to create some content on bilibili, I started to make this mod.

# 🧐What We Have Now?
- Overdue enchantment for foods;
- Binding curse, throns enchantment for bed;
- Mending, spreading enchantment for cake;
- Loyalty enchantment for thrown items;
- Removed the limit of enchantment, now you can apply any enchantment to any item (no matter if it functions).

This mod is just for fun. If you are particularly concerned about balance, please do not use this mod.
